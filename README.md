# Creating a Simple Recommender System

Recommender systems can be found in every corner of the internet. They are a strong driver for sales and product introduction on any website selling goods or services, aiming to match each user to the available products and services according to their preferences.

This project aims to first analyse the Amazon bestseller dataset containing the top fifty titles for each year starting in 2009 and ending in 2019, and then build a simple recommender system based on NearestNeighbors clustering and degree of cosine similarity. The Amazon bestseller dataset is available from the Kaggle website.
